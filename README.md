## üìã Configuration Options

The WiFi Manager can be customized through the following defines in `wifi_manager.h`:

```cpp
// WiFi Configuration
#define AP_SSID "AccessPointWiFi"    // Default AP name
#define AP_PASSWORD "12345678"       // Default AP password
#define AP_CHANNEL 1                 // WiFi channel
#define AP_MAX_CONN 4                // Maximum simultaneous connections

// Timeouts
#define WIFI_CONNECT_TIMEOUT 10000   // Connection timeout (ms)
#define AP_MODE_TIMEOUT 300000       // Auto-disable AP after time (ms)
#define WIFI_CHECK_INTERVAL 15000    // Connection check interval (ms)

// System Configuration
#define MAX_NETWORKS 5               // Maximum stored networks
#define MAX_CONNECT_ATTEMPTS 2       // Connection attempts before fallback
```
