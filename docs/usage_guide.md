- IP Address
- Signal Strength
- Connection Status
- Uptime

## üìä Monitoring & Statistics

### Network Status Monitor

The Network Status card shows real-time information about your connection:

- **SSID**: The name of the connected network
- **IP Address**: Your device's IP address on the network
- **Signal**: Signal strength in dBm (higher is better)
- **Status**: Connection status (Connected/Disconnected)
- **Uptime**: How long the connection has been active

### Connection History

The Connection History card shows:
- Recent connection attempts
- Time of connection
- Success or failure status
- Signal strength at time of connection

This helps you troubleshoot connection issues by showing patterns.

### Network Statistics

The Network Statistics card provides:
- Success rate for each network
- Number of successful connections
- Number of failed connections
- Overall reliability metrics

Use this to identify problematic networks or connection patterns.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Device Settings

### Customizing the Access Point

1. Scroll down to the Device Settings card.
2. Click on "Access Point Settings".
3. A modal window will appear with settings.

4. Enter your desired Access Point Name (SSID).
5. Enter a new password or leave blank to keep the existing one.
6. Click "Save".
7. A message will indicate that settings were saved.
8. Restart the device to apply the new AP settings.

## üîç Advanced Features

### Multiple Network Management

The device stores up to 5 network credentials. When powered on, it will:
1. Attempt to connect to the last successful network.
2. If that fails, try other stored networks in order.
3. Fall back to AP mode if all connection attempts fail.

### Automatic Reconnection

If the WiFi connection drops:
1. The device will automatically attempt to reconnect.
2. If reconnection fails after 2 attempts, it will:
   - Fall back to AP mode
   - Continue trying to reconnect periodically

### Signal Strength Indicators

The signal strength is displayed in both:
- Numerical form (dBm)
- Visual form (bars) in the network selection dropdown

Generally:
- -50 to -60 dBm: Excellent
- -60 to -70 dBm: Good
- -70 to -80 dBm: Fair
- -80 to -90 dBm: Poor

## üîÑ Updating the Device

### Firmware Updates

To update the firmware:
1. Download the latest firmware from the repository.
2. Connect the ESP8266 device to your computer.
3. Use the Arduino IDE or similar tool to upload the new firmware.
4. After updating, reset the device.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Device Won't Create Access Point

**Solution:**
1. Reset the device by pressing the reset button.
2. Check power connection - ensure stable power supply.
3. If problem persists, try flashing the firmware again.

### Can't Connect to WiFi Network

**Solutions:**
1. Verify correct password entry.
2. Check if the network is within range.
3. Verify the network supports the ESP8266 (2.4GHz, compatible security).
4. Try rebooting your router.

### Web Interface Doesn't Load

**Solutions:**
1. Verify you're connected to the correct AP network.
2. Try a different browser.
3. Clear browser cache.
4. Check that you're using the correct IP address (http://192.168.4.1).

### Device Frequently Disconnects

**Solutions:**
1. Check signal strength - move closer to router if poor.
2. Ensure stable power supply.
3. Check router settings - some routers disconnect inactive clients.
4. Update to the latest firmware.

## üì± Mobile Usage Tips

### iOS Devices

- iOS may prompt "This network has no internet connection." This is normal.
- Select "Use Without Internet" or similar option.
- If the captive portal doesn't appear automatically, open Safari and navigate to http://192.168.4.1.

### Android Devices

- Android may show "Internet may not be available." This is normal.
- Tap "Yes" to stay connected.
- If the captive portal doesn't appear, open Chrome and navigate to http://192.168.4.1.

## üîí Security Considerations

- Change the default AP password immediately after setup.
- Use strong passwords for both AP and WiFi networks.
- The device stores passwords in EEPROM, which is not encrypted by default.
- For critical applications, consider implementing additional security measures.
